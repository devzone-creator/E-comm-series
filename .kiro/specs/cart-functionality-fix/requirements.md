# Cart Functionality Fix - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The shopping cart functionality in the AfriGlam e-commerce platform is currently broken. Users cannot successfully add items to their cart, and when they navigate to the cart page, it remains empty. This critical issue has persisted for over a week and needs immediate resolution to restore basic e-commerce functionality.

## Current Issues Identified

1. Add to cart button clicks do not result in items being added to the cart
2. Cart page shows empty even after attempting to add items
3. No proper error handling or user feedback when cart operations fail
4. Authentication flow may be interfering with cart operations
5. Session management issues preventing cart persistence

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Functional Add to Cart

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to add products to my cart from the product details page, so that I can purchase multiple items together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a logged-in user clicks "Add to Cart" on a product details page THEN the item SHALL be successfully added to their cart
2. WHEN the item is successfully added THEN the user SHALL see a success message confirming the addition
3. WHEN the item is successfully added THEN the user SHALL be redirected to the cart page within 2 seconds
4. WHEN a user adds an item that already exists in their cart THEN the quantity SHALL be updated appropriately
5. WHEN a user tries to add more items than available in stock THEN they SHALL receive an error message

### Requirement 2: Cart Persistence and Display

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to see all items I've added to my cart when I visit the cart page, so that I can review my selections before checkout.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the cart page THEN all previously added items SHALL be displayed
2. WHEN the cart page loads THEN it SHALL show product name, image, price, quantity, and total for each item
3. WHEN the cart is empty THEN the page SHALL display a clear "Your cart is empty" message
4. WHEN cart data fails to load THEN the user SHALL see an appropriate error message
5. WHEN a user refreshes the cart page THEN their cart contents SHALL persist

### Requirement 3: Authentication Integration

**User Story:** As a customer, I want the cart functionality to work seamlessly with the login system, so that I don't lose my cart contents when logging in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a non-logged-in user clicks "Add to Cart" THEN they SHALL be redirected to login
2. WHEN a user logs in after attempting to add to cart THEN they SHALL be redirected back to the product page
3. WHEN a user successfully logs in and returns to the product page THEN they SHALL be able to add items to cart
4. WHEN a logged-in user adds items to cart THEN the session SHALL properly maintain their cart state
5. WHEN a user logs out and logs back in THEN their cart contents SHALL be preserved

### Requirement 4: Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a customer, I want clear feedback when cart operations succeed or fail, so that I understand what's happening with my cart.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any cart operation succeeds THEN the user SHALL see a clear success message
2. WHEN any cart operation fails THEN the user SHALL see a specific error message explaining what went wrong
3. WHEN there are network issues THEN the user SHALL see a "Please try again" message
4. WHEN the user is not authenticated THEN they SHALL see a "Please log in" message
5. WHEN a product is out of stock THEN the user SHALL see a stock availability message

### Requirement 5: Cart API Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the cart API endpoints to be reliable and properly handle all edge cases, so that the cart functionality works consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the `/api/cart/add` endpoint is called with valid data THEN it SHALL return a success response
2. WHEN the `/api/cart` endpoint is called THEN it SHALL return the user's current cart contents
3. WHEN cart operations encounter database errors THEN they SHALL be properly logged and handled
4. WHEN invalid data is sent to cart endpoints THEN they SHALL return appropriate validation errors
5. WHEN the cart service methods are called THEN they SHALL properly handle all database operations

### Requirement 6: Database Integration

**User Story:** As a system, I want cart data to be properly stored and retrieved from the database, so that cart operations are persistent and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN items are added to cart THEN they SHALL be stored in the cart_items table
2. WHEN cart items are retrieved THEN they SHALL include all necessary product information
3. WHEN cart operations modify data THEN the changes SHALL be immediately reflected in subsequent queries
4. WHEN database connections fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully
5. WHEN cart data is queried THEN it SHALL include proper joins with products and user tables
